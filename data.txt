I'm Prem Kumar, an AI Engineer and Data Scientist passionate about building intelligent systems that drive real-world impact. My journey into AI began with a curiosity about how machines can reason, interact, and adapt like humans—which soon evolved into a deep commitment to applied AI innovation.

With a solid foundation in computer science, mathematics, and data engineering, I specialize in deploying end-to-end AI solutions. My work spans machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and large language models (LLMs), with hands-on experience implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using LangChain, Qdrant, and open-source LLMs. I build and deploy scalable AI applications using Flask, FastAPI, and vector databases to solve domain-specific problems in sectors like education, healthcare, and real estate.

I’m passionate about combining data science with practical engineering to make AI accessible, transparent, and effective. When I’m not coding or fine-tuning models, I enjoy mentoring aspiring AI engineers, writing technical content, and exploring open-source projects that push the boundaries of agentic AI.
